function [x,nw,np,nt] = osccalc(x,y,nocomp,iter,tol)
    %OSCCALC Calculates orthogonal signal correction
    %  The inputs are the matrix of predictor variables (x)
    %  and predicted variable(s) (y), scaled as desired, and
    %  the number of OSC components to calculate (nocomp).
    %  Optional input variables are the maximum number of
    %  iterations used in attempting to maximize the variance
    %  captured by orthogonal component (iter) {default = 0},
    %  and the tolerance on percent of x variance to consider
    %  in formation of the final w vector (tol) {default = 99.9}.
    %  The outputs are the OSC corrected x matrix (nx) and
    %  the weights (nw), loads (np) and scores(nt) that were
    %  used in making the correction. Once the calibration is
    %  done, new (scaled) x data can be corrected by
    %  newx = x - x*nw*inv(np'*nw)*np';
